# A work-around for the Ansible 2.8.0 error: -
#
#       yum lockfile is held by another process
#
# This is seen during yum/package operations. An error not seen
# in Ansible 2.7 and the problem appears to be caused by one of these
# lingering processes...
#
# root      3191 33.0  0.7 331812 30828 ?        D    14:46   0:00 /usr/bin/python -tt /sbin/yum-complete-transaction -c /etc/yum.conf -y
#
# root      3766 88.0  4.3 387268 168832 ?       R    15:38   0:03 /usr/bin/python -tt /bin/repoquery -c /etc/yum.conf [...]
#
# Here we grep for processes containing 'yum'.
# If we only get two responses then the lock is free.
# If all's good the result of the shell-command on the host is: -
#
# root      5901  0.0  0.0 113176  1216 ?        S    15:16   0:00 /bin/sh -c ps -aux | grep yum
# root      5903  0.0  0.0 112708   956 ?        S    15:16   0:00 grep yum
#
# So, if we don't count more than 2 lines we're "good to go".
#
# just 'import' this task before any yum/package operation
# in your playbook/role...
